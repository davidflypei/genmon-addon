# Genmon Addon for Home Assistant

This is a very jank addon that was cooked up quickly. It does work but likely will not receive any
QoL improvements. Issues are also unlikely to be responded to.

To make this function:
	1. Start Addon and wait for config files to be populated.
	2. Stop addon
	3. Set `use_serial_tcp` to `True` in genmon.conf within the config folder at `/config/genmon`
